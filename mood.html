    <!-- Explanation of HTML -->
    <!-- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages
         and web applications. It defines the structure and content of a webpage through various
         elements and attributes. HTML documents consist of nested tags that describe the
         structure of the content. These tags are interpreted by web browsers to render the
         webpage accordingly. In this document, we use HTML to create a simple webpage for creating
         mood boards by embedding Spotify playlists. -->
